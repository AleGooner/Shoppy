# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Fixtures.html
# A fixture is an environment in which you can run a test. In Rails, a test fixutres is specification
# of the initial contents of a model (or models) under test. If we want to ensure that our products
#  table starts off with known data at the start of every unit test, we can specify those contents in a
# fixture, and Rails will take care of the rest. Each fixture file contains the data for a single model.
# The name of a fixture is significant; the base name of the file must match the name of a database
# table. Because we need some data for a Product model, which is stored in the products table, we'll
# add it to this file. Rails automatically generated this file when we first created the model.
